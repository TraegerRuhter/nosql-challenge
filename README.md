# NoSQL Challange - UK Food Standards Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the work of a comprehensive analysis of food hygiene ratings across various establishments in the United Kingdom. Conducted for "Eat Safe, Love" magazine, this project entailed the use of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to perform exploratory data analysis on the UK Food Standards Agency's ratings data.

## Key Achievements

1. **Database Setup and Data Import**:
   - Successfully imported and set up a MongoDB database named `uk_food` with a collection `establishments` containing data from `establishments.json`.
   - Demonstrated proficiency in using MongoDB commands and PyMongo for database operations.

2. **Database Update and Data Modification**:
   - Expanded the database by adding a new restaurant, "Penang Flavours," into the `establishments` collection.
   - Performed updates to existing data, including the conversion of latitude, longitude, and RatingValue fields to appropriate data types.

3. **Data Exploration and Analysis**:
   - Conducted a series of exploratory analyses to answer specific questions posed by the magazine, focusing on hygiene scores and rating values.
   - Utilized MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for complex queries, such as determining the number of establishments with specific hygiene scores within each Local Authority area.
   - Applied sorting, grouping, and filtering techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data.

4. **Insights on Food Hygiene Ratings**:
   - Identified establishments with critical hygiene scores and high rating values, providing valuable insights for the magazine's articles.
   - Analyzed the geographic distribution of establishments based on hygiene and overall ratings, highlighting areas of interest for food critics and journalists.

5. **Technical Documentation and Code Quality**:
   - Maintained a well-documented Jupyter Notebook with clear, concise comments, making the analysis easily understandable and reproducible.
   - Ensured robustness in code with thorough testing and validation steps.

## Key Takeaways
This project exemplified the power of MongoDB in handling and analyzing large datasets. It showcased the ability to glean critical insights from data that can guide real-world decisions in the food and hospitality industry. The skills demonstrated here are crucial for data-driven decision-making and strategic planning in various sectors.
